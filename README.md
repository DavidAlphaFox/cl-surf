## Very easy self-hosted site search #

My goal with Breeze is to make it trivially easy to install quality site search on an Apache or Hunchentoot hosted site.  It's completely functional for small to medium-sized sites at the moment, but needs tweaks to the way it retrieves cached information from disk and processes terms (need to add stemming) before it will be quality persay.

Plan to write installer scripts for Apache and Hunchentoot.

Unless you're willing to hack around a bit, please come back later!
