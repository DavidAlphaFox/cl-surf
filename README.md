# CL-SURF#
## Very easy self-hosted site search #

My goal with Cl-Surf is to make it trivially easy to install simple site search on an Apache or Hunchentoot hosted site.  It's completely functional for smaller sites at the moment, but needs tweaks to the way it retrieves cached information from disk and processes terms (need to add stemming) before it will be quality persay.

Plan to write installer scripts for Apache and Hunchentoot. But as of now, installation is essentially undocumented.

Unless you're willing to hack around a bit, please come back later!
